# Microservice Forge

Welcome to Microservice Forge - your hub for learning and educating on microservice design patterns!

## About Microservice Forge

Microservice Forge is an open community dedicated to providing resources, tutorials, and practical examples for understanding and implementing microservice design patterns. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, our goal is to make the world of microservices accessible and engaging.

## What You'll Find Here

Microservices are the hard part! They tempt everyone to use them at first glance. You are very excited to build a microservice for each part of your application! A profile microservice,  accounting microservice, user account microservice, a search engine microservice and so on. But after this honeymoon ends doon and the real nightmare appears!
How should I connect these creatures? How should I debug them and what is the deployment strategy? 
Your production is a huge machine with different moving parts! What do you do when your machine stops working?!
And you may get tired and frustrated and tell yourself in your mind that the monolithic architecture was very good. Why did I decide to use microservices?! :)))
I try to help you build better microservices by sharing my knowledge with you! If you build your microservice application with tested design patterns the chances that you face difficulties in future phrases of your projects is much less.
The problem is in microservices is there is a big amount of theory but the implementation details are not clear. When you want to build your microservice application you would understand how difficult it is to use an implementation path. I tried to appeal a useful microservice application fees using popular design pattern of microservice architecture
I used Java for the back end side, Because it's well structured and an established programming language and also has robust and production grade frameworks like Spring boot and quartz.
I want to build a fully functional cryptocurrency trading bot that signals the user about market situations using predefined algorithms using different microservices using microservice design patterns.
I plan to build this project in my free time and my free time is very limited!
